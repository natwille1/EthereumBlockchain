# Simulated financial market hosted on the Ethereum Blockhain network. 

This repository contains code to build smart contracts using the solidity programming language, and a user interface leveraging the bootstrap framework. The DApp is hosted on Truffle, an Ethereum network simulator. 

The smart contract offers users with Ethereum bank accounts the ability to purchase tokens as part of an investment in any of 3 different simulated companies. Ether is used to purchase the tokens, and the initial coin offering is tracked on the blockchain. The front-end is buit using the Bootstrap framework, offering a web interface to browse company offerings and purchase tokens. The Web3.js library is used to integrate web actions with calculations performed by the smart contract. 

The repo serves as a proof-of-concept project for developing DApps on open-source blockchain simulators.
